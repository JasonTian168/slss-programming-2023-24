# Headings
We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols
To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash symbols
## This is a level 2 subheading

### This is a level 3 subheading 
###### This is a level 6 subheading

# Modifying Text Style
## BOLD AND ITALICS
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling specifically, bold and italics
e.g.
I want this **word** specifically to be bold
I want this *word* to be italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized

**ASIDE**: If we want to place a character that is a *KEYWORD* and we want the *LITERAL* character , use the back slash (\\) 
	e.g. if we want to put an asterisks, we do this **
## Strikethrough
We can also strikethrough characters using the tilde (~)
I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word
The sentence is struck through~

## Links 
We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use.](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise:
* If you have an Openai account, do the following:
	* Ask Chatgpt to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice
	* If you don't have chatgpt/openai, create two links to websites of your choice in the space below
	e.g. [My favourite website right now.](https://www.google.com)

	e.g. if you use Openai
	Put in their code, and in *italics* say that it's from Chatgpt
	1 [Google](https://google.com/)) 
	2 [Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com)
	*from Chatgpt*
	
## Images

## Method One
e.g.

# Blockquotes
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunck of text 
We use carets (>) to create block quotes 

> This is an example of block quotes
> This is line two of the block quote
> 
> This is the forth line; the third is blank

# Lists
We can create both unordered and ordered lists

# Unordered Lists
To create each point, we use ( * ) with a space behind it
We can create sublists by placing TABS before the asterisks.

e.g.
* dairy
	* eggs
	* milk
	* cheese
* juice

## Ordered Lists
If there is a specific order to the elements in out list, we create ordered lists
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists

e.g.
1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to butter
   Add both brown and regular sugar
3. Use the mixer to cream the butter and sugar together

# Tables 
We can organize information in tables using markdown
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|)

Tables in Markdown require headings

e.g.

|  Name     |  Age      | Sign     | Superpower    |
|  ---      |  ---      | ---      | 
|  Jason Tian| 16       | Scorpio  | Super Strength|
