Modules are bits of code that we can use in Python 
These bits of code aren't automatically included, so we need to **import** them into our code

# Import 
The import key word loads the module into our file
*imports* should be at the **top of the file** under the **header**

# The time module
Time allows us to play around with everything related to time
We can pause our code using **time**

```python
import time

# Pause code for 1 second
time.sleep(1)
```
