# Natural Language Processing 
## Output
We can use a function to display texts and symbols to the screen
We use the `print()` function to display output

```python
print("your text goes in here. ")

input("Whats your favorite food")

```

## Input
We grab information from the user using the input `input()`
When we run the function it does two things:
1. it **waits** for the user to write something or nothing
2. The user presses **Enter/Return** to indicate that they're finished.

```python
input()

input(<prompt>)            # prints out the prompt then waits
```

## Variables
Variables allow us to store information for the time that our app is running.

```python
favorite_food = input("What is your favorite food? ")
```

favourite_food -> name of the variable
= -> assignment operator
input... -> value


# Naming
What you can do:
1. nam them with letters, numbers, and underscores
2. names **should** start with a lowercase letter
What you can't do:
1. you can't name them with spaces and symbols
2. you can't name them with certain names that are reserved
	1. e.g.  `if, while, for, and, or, ....

A good name is something like this:

```python
favourite_food
fav_food
date_of_birth
student_number
```

Bad names are like this:
```python
Favourite_food
a
num
aa
aaa
aaaa
```
